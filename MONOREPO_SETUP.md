# Boomerang Monorepo Setup Complete! ðŸŽ‰

## Overview

I've successfully created a monorepo structure for your BoomerangConnect project that allows you to share code between web (Next.js) and mobile (React Native/Expo) platforms.

## Project Structure

```
boomerang-monorepo/
â”œâ”€â”€ apps/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ web/          # Next.js 14 web application
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ mobile/       # Expo React Native mobile app
â”œâ”€â”€ packages/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ core/         # Shared business logic, types, and utilities
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ui/           # Shared UI components (works on both web and mobile)
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json      # Root workspace configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.base.json # Base TypeScript configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ test-monorepo.sh  # Test script to verify setup
â””â”€â”€ README.md         # Project documentation
```

## What's Been Created

### 1. Shared Packages

#### `@boomerang/core`
- **Theme**: Starbucks-inspired design system with colors, typography, spacing, and shadows
- **Types**: Zod schemas for providers, referral loops, trust points, users, and activities
- **Utils**: Helper functions for trust tier calculations, date formatting, etc.

#### `@boomerang/ui`
- **Text**: Typography component with variants (h1, h2, h3, body, caption, label)
- **Button**: Interactive button with variants (primary, secondary, outline, ghost)
- **Stack**: Layout component for spacing and alignment
- **Card**: Container component with elevation options

### 2. Web App (Next.js 14)
- Modern Next.js setup with App Router
- React Native Web integration for shared components
- TypeScript configuration
- Environment variables setup for Firebase
- Starbucks-inspired design

### 3. Mobile App (Expo)
- Expo SDK 50 with expo-router
- TypeScript configuration
- Tab-based navigation structure
- Shared UI components from the monorepo
- Starbucks-inspired design

## Key Features

âœ… **Code Sharing**: UI components work on both web and mobile  
âœ… **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support across all packages  
âœ… **Design System**: Consistent Starbucks-inspired theme  
âœ… **Modern Stack**: Next.js 14 + Expo SDK 50  
âœ… **Monorepo**: Single repository for all platforms  
âœ… **Testing**: Comprehensive test script to verify setup  

## Next Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd boomerang-monorepo
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
```bash
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.local
# Edit apps/web/.env.local with your Firebase configuration
```

### 3. Start Development
```bash
# Start both web and mobile development servers
npm run dev

# Or start them individually:
npm run dev:web    # Web only (http://localhost:3000)
npm run dev:mobile # Mobile only (scan QR with Expo Go)
```

### 4. Test the Setup
```bash
./test-monorepo.sh
```

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start both web and mobile development servers
- `npm run dev:web` - Start web development server only
- `npm run dev:mobile` - Start mobile development server only
- `npm run build` - Build the web application
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint across all packages

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Code Reuse**: UI components are shared between platforms
2. **Consistency**: Single design system across web and mobile
3. **Type Safety**: Shared TypeScript types prevent bugs
4. **Maintenance**: Single repository for easier maintenance
5. **Development**: Hot reloading for both platforms simultaneously

## Migration Path

To migrate your existing components:

1. Move shared components to `packages/ui/src/components/`
2. Move business logic to `packages/core/src/`
3. Update imports to use `@boomerang/ui` and `@boomerang/core`
4. Test on both platforms

## Firebase Integration

The monorepo is ready for Firebase integration:
- Environment variables are configured
- Firebase SDK is included in both apps
- Analytics and authentication can be shared across platforms

## Deployment

- **Web**: Deploy to Vercel using the Next.js app
- **Mobile**: Build with Expo EAS or use Expo Go for development

ðŸŽ‰ **Your monorepo is ready!** Start developing with shared components across web and mobile platforms.
